# React-Color-Picker
React / Typescript app to select and save colors in different formats. 

## Description

This web-app, built with React/TypeScript using NodeJs let's the user experiment with different color formats: HSL, RGB and HEX. The lower half of the screen shows your library of colors (initially, 10 random colors). The left side of the screen allows you to adjust the HSL value of the chosen color and the right side let's you adjust it through other color formats.
